  While working through HC 7, I wanted to try my best at using data from different rows of the Airbnb spreadsheet and create multiple different types of plots. For this reason, I chose to visualize data in the forms of a scatterplot, pie chart, bar graph, and box plot. In the scatterplot, I chose to use the longitude and latitude values from the spreadsheet to create a plot with the distribution of the Airbnb listings throughout Forest Hills. When comparing this to a map of forest hills, it is obvious that the area outlined by the scatterplot matches the general shape of forest hills. Thinking about the zoning of this community, it makes sense that such a scatter is apparent, as in HC2 and 3 I discovered that forest Hills is an almost entirely residential community, so it makes sense that Airbnb is listed throughout the neighborhood. Knowing this as well as the fact that homeownership and home rental is evenly split also explains why the pie chart of entire homes vs. private rooms is evenly split. Since many of these listings are homes, some have people living in them full time, so they only rent out a private room, and others are owned by landlords so they are entire homes.
  While looking at the bar graph of all Queens neighborhoods and the boxplot of Forest Hills listing, further statistical analysis is required. From only the bar graph, it is apparent that Forest Hills listings are generally more expensive than listings in other areas. When examining the box plot, we realize that the mean price is very skewed due to the extreme positive outlier of $2350. For this reason, I choose to use the median data point as it is more representative of the center. Since the 144 listings have a median value of $80 per night, Forest Hills seems much more similar to the other lower-priced Queens neighborhoods. In terms of mode of minimum nights, 0 makes sense with some of the houses being owned by landlords–many are able to rent out the house for however long or however short they would like, and the other mode of 2 makes sense because many people that rent out may need to hire a cleaning crew, and the charge for only one night may not be enough to pay for the cleaning and also make a profit.
